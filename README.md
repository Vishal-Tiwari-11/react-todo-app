# React To-Do App

This is a simple To-Do List application built with React. The app allows users to manage their tasks effectively by adding, completing, and deleting tasks. 
Each task is displayed with a unique number to help users keep track of their progress easily.

## Features

- Add New Tasks: Users can add new tasks to the list by typing into the input field and clicking the "Add Task" button.
- Mark Tasks as Completed: Users can mark tasks as completed by clicking the "Complete" button next to each task. Completed tasks will be styled with a strikethrough to indicate they are done.
- Delete Tasks: Users can remove tasks from the list by clicking the "Delete" button.
- Numbered Task List: Each task is displayed with a unique number to help users easily keep track of their tasks.

## Technologies Used
